# dridi

Hi, I'm a systems developer working for Varnish Software.

I use my GitHub account primarily for my professional work on Varnish
Cache and contributions to projects hosted here.

My personal projects, including projects related to Varnish, are hosted
on [sourcehut](https://sr.ht/~dridi/) and some of them used to live on
GitHub:

- [bjxa](https://sr.ht/~dridi/bjxa/) (a BandJAM XA audio codec)
- [varnishplot](https://git.sr.ht/~dridi/varnishplot) (turns Varnish logs
  into Gnuplot scripts)
- [vcdk](https://git.sr.ht/~dridi/vcdk) (Varnish Cache Development Kit)
- [vclpp](https://git.sr.ht/~dridi/vclpp) (experimental VCL preprocessor)
- [vmod-querystring](https://git.sr.ht/~dridi/vmod-querystring)
  (query-string filtering toolkit for Varnish)

Other projects still on GitHub will eventually move to sourcehut.

I contribute to the Fedora project and use my front page hosted there to
[write](https://dridi.fedorapeople.org/) about random topics and mostly
for myself.
